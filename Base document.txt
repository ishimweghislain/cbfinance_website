Recommended Color Palette (Good Combinations)
Stick close to the logo for brand consistency, but expand it professionally.
Primary palette (must-use):

Main Green: #008000 to #00A651 (emerald/forest green – energetic yet stable)
Main Blue: #003366 to #0047AB (deep navy/royal blue – for trust)
Accent Light Blue: #4FC3F7 or #00BFFF (for gradients/arcs/CTA buttons)

Supporting neutrals (essential for websites):

White (#FFFFFF) – clean backgrounds
Light gray (#F5F7FA or #E8ECEF) – sections, cards
Dark gray/charcoal (#333333 or #2C3E50) – text, footer
Off-black (#1A1F2E) – for headers/important text

Complementary accents (to add energy without clashing):

Gold/Yellow-gold (#D4AF37 or #C9A347) – subtle highlights for success/wealth (use sparingly on icons, borders, or "Invest Now" buttons)
Soft teal (#26A69A) – bridge between green and blue for hover effects/animations
